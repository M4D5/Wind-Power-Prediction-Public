# Wind Power Prediction

Wind power forecasting involves predicting the amount of electricity that will be generated by a wind farm at a future point in time. This is important for maintaining the stability of power grids, as the unpredictable nature of wind power can make it challenging to integrate into the grid.

In the described paper, the authors used a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to forecast wind power generation. LSTM neural networks are a type of artificial neural network that are well-suited for processing sequential data, such as time series data.

The data used for this project (but not included) was provided by Metodyn China, which included numerical weather predictions and actual measurements of wind power generation. Reasearch found that a simpler model structure resulted in the best performance, and that the model was able to capture the dynamic and trend of power generation effectively. It was also concluded that the accuracy of the model was more heavily influenced by the quality of the data and the way it was prepared (i.e., feature engineering) than by the hyperparameters of the model (i.e., the values of the parameters that are set prior to training).
