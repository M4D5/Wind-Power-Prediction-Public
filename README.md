# Wind Power Prediction

## Abstract (From Paper)

Wind power forecasting is crucial to enhance the stability of power integration in power grids. This paper presents how a LSTM neural network can be applied to forecast the power generation from a wind farm. 
The data used to train the model is provided by Metodyn China. The data consists of numerical weather predictions and actual measurements. It is found that a more simple model structure generates the best results, 
and that the model can effectively capture the dynamic and trend of power generation. It was further concluded that the feature engineering and data preparation coarsely affected the modelâ€™s output accuracy, 
while hyperparameter tuning was of less significance.
